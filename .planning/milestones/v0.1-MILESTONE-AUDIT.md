# Milestone Audit: v1 - Core Experience

**Audited:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Gaps Found (pending phases 9-12 not yet executed)

## Executive Summary

The v1 milestone has **37 of 54 requirements satisfied** from the completed phases (1 through 8.2). All 10 executed phases passed verification. Cross-phase integration is clean with 35+ connections verified and all 7 E2E user flows traced end-to-end with zero broken connections.

The 17 unsatisfied requirements are **all mapped to phases 9-12 which have not yet been executed**. These are not regressions or gaps in completed work — they are planned future work.

**Bottom line:** All completed work is solid. The remaining requirements need their phases planned and executed.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Score | Status | Gap Closures | Key Note |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1. AI Streaming Infrastructure | 11/11 | Passed | 0 | Clean first-time pass |
| 2. Basic Chat Interface | 18/18 | Passed | 0 | Human-verified |
| 3. Thread Management | 6/6 | Passed | 1 (stream abort fix) | Re-verified after fix |
| 4. Model Selection | 22/22 | Passed | 1 (picker dropdown fix) | Re-verified after fix |
| 5. Sidebar & Navigation | 5/5 | Passed | 0 | Clean first-time pass |
| 6. Sidekiq CRUD | 7/7 | Passed | 0 | Clean first-time pass |

| 8.1. Branding/UI Overhaul | 13/13 | Passed | 0 | ~55 files updated, build verified |

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Integration Health: 100%

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Key exports verified | 35+ | All connected |
| Orphaned exports | 0 | Clean |
| Missing connections | 0 | Clean |
| Broken links | 0 | Clean |

### E2E User Flows

| Flow | Steps Traced | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| New User: Sign up -> first message -> thread created | 9 steps | Complete |
| Model Selection: Pick model -> message -> persistence -> restore | 7 steps | Complete |
| Sidekiq Creation: Browse -> create -> sidebar -> chat -> personality | 10 steps | Complete |
| Thread Management: Create -> pin -> archive -> search -> delete | 6 steps | Complete |
| Team Creation: Navigate -> create -> invite -> accept -> member list | 10 steps | Complete |
| Sidebar Navigation: Icon rail -> panels -> search -> shortcuts | 5 steps | Complete |
| Sidekiq Switch: Sidekiq A -> switch to B -> model update -> remount | 6 steps | Complete |

### Architecture Strengths

1. **Type-safe integration** - TypeScript strict mode + Zod validation at all boundaries
2. **Optimistic updates** - All mutations include optimistic UI with rollback
3. **Cache management** - Proper tRPC `utils.invalidate()` ensures UI freshness
4. **Clean separation** - API layer (tRPC) -> Hook layer (use*Actions) -> Component layer
5. **URL-driven state** - Sidebar panel switching via pathname, not React state
6. **Auth protection** - Dashboard layout enforces session, tRPC uses `protectedProcedure`

---

## Tech Debt

### By Phase

**Phase 2: Basic Chat Interface**
- Edit/regenerate message actions show "coming soon" toast placeholders (deferred to v2)

**Phase 6: Sidekiq CRUD**
- Rate limit mismatch: REQUIREMENTS.md says 10 creations/hour, code implements 25/hour (matches ROADMAP success criteria)
- KIQQ-07 (100 Sidekiqs per user) deferred to subscription system

**Phase 8: Team Foundation**
- Database migration (0002_team_schema_sync.sql) applied via manual psql, needs human verification that Docker + DB are in sync
- Team list query not runtime-verified

**Phase 8.1: Branding/UI**
- 2 unused imports generating ESLint warnings (SidekiqAvatar, TeamRole)

**Misc**
- 3 stale/empty phase directories in `.planning/phases/` that should be cleaned up

### Total: 8 items across 5 categories

**Severity:** None are blockers. All are minor cleanup or documentation items.

---

## Conclusion

The v1 milestone has solid foundational work through Phase 8.2. All executed phases pass verification with clean cross-phase integration. The remaining 16 unsatisfied requirements (+ 1 deferred) need their respective phases (9-12) planned and executed to complete the milestone.

**Critical path to milestone completion:**
1. Phase 9: Team Sidekiq Sharing (TEAM-07, TEAM-08, TEAM-09, TEAM-10)
2. Phase 10: Error Handling (ERRR-01 through ERRR-04)
3. Phase 11: UI/UX Animations (UIUX-04, UIUX-05, UIUX-06)
4. Phase 12: Loading States & Polish (UIUX-07, UIUX-08, UIUX-10, UIUX-11)

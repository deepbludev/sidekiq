<current_state>
Phase 6 execution was interrupted by rate limit during Wave 3 completion.

**Wave 3 Status:**
- 06-05 (Conversation starters + instructions editor): CODE COMPLETE, SUMMARY MISSING
- 06-06 (Avatar customization): CODE COMPLETE, SUMMARY UNCOMMITTED

All Wave 3 code is committed but the agents hit rate limit before creating/committing their summary files.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Wave 1 (Complete):**
- 06-01: Schema extensions + tRPC router - DONE (SUMMARY committed)
- 06-02: Dependencies + utilities - DONE (SUMMARY committed)

**Wave 2 (Complete):**
- 06-03: List page + empty state + sidebar section - DONE (SUMMARY committed)
- 06-04: Create form with split layout and live preview - DONE (SUMMARY committed)

**Wave 3 (Code Complete, Summaries Pending):**
- 06-05: Conversation starters (drag-drop) + instructions editor (markdown) - CODE COMMITTED
  - Commits: a9d35fc, 486a393, 07e3588
  - Missing: 06-05-SUMMARY.md
- 06-06: Avatar customization (color picker + emoji picker) - CODE COMMITTED
  - Commits: 08fd2ed, bc3b384, 72cb98e
  - Created but uncommitted: 06-06-SUMMARY.md
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Immediate (cleanup Wave 3):**
1. Create 06-05-SUMMARY.md based on commits
2. Commit 06-06-SUMMARY.md
3. Create plan completion commits for both plans

**Wave 4:**
- 06-07: Edit page + templates + final verification
  - `autonomous: false` - has human checkpoint
  - This is the final plan in Phase 6

**Post-Phase:**
- Run gsd-verifier to verify phase goal
- Update ROADMAP.md and STATE.md
- Update REQUIREMENTS.md
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Custom in-memory rate limiter instead of @trpc-limiter/memory (06-01)
- 25 creations/hour limit for Sidekiq anti-spam (06-01)
- Case-insensitive name uniqueness via SQL LOWER() (06-01)
- djb2 hash algorithm for deterministic avatar colors (06-02)
- Optimistic updates for sidekiq delete and toggleFavorite (06-02)
- localStorage key 'sidekiq-view-preference' for grid/list toggle (06-02)
- Sidebar Sidekiq click navigates to edit, not chat (Phase 7 integration pending) (06-03)
- Type-to-confirm delete with exact name match (06-03)
- Sidebar shows max 5 Sidekiqs with favorites first (06-03)
- Separate sidekiqFormSchema without Zod defaults for React Hook Form (06-04)
- useWatch with explicit type narrowing for avatar fields (06-04)
- beforeunload warning for unsaved form changes (06-04)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Rate limit hit on Wave 3 agent spawning - will reset at 1pm Costa Rica time
- No code blockers - all Wave 3 features are implemented and committed
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 6 execution was going smoothly with wave-based parallelization:
- Waves 1-2 completed successfully
- Wave 3 agents (06-05 and 06-06) ran in parallel and completed their code
- Both agents hit rate limit before fully finishing their summary/completion workflow

The actual feature code is all committed. What's missing is:
1. Documentation (SUMMARY files)
2. Plan completion commits
3. Wave 4 execution (06-07 with checkpoint)
4. Phase verification

The model profile is "quality" (opus for executor, sonnet for verifier).

<files_to_review>
Key components created in Phase 6:
- sidekiq-webapp/src/server/api/routers/sidekiq.ts (tRPC router)
- sidekiq-webapp/src/lib/validations/sidekiq.ts (Zod schemas)
- sidekiq-webapp/src/components/sidekiq/*.tsx (all UI components)
- sidekiq-webapp/src/hooks/use-sidekiq-actions.ts (mutation hook)
- sidekiq-webapp/src/hooks/use-view-preference.ts (view preference hook)
- sidekiq-webapp/src/app/(dashboard)/sidekiqs/**/*.tsx (pages)
</files_to_review>

<next_action>
1. First, cleanup Wave 3:
   - Read commits a9d35fc, 486a393, 07e3588 to create 06-05-SUMMARY.md
   - Commit 06-06-SUMMARY.md
   - Create plan completion commits

2. Then execute Wave 4:
   - Spawn gsd-executor for 06-07 (has checkpoint - autonomous: false)
   - Handle checkpoint when agent returns

3. Finally, complete phase:
   - Spawn gsd-verifier
   - Update STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md
   - Commit phase completion

To resume: `/gsd:resume-work` or `/gsd:execute-phase 6` (will skip completed plans)

# Phase 08.1 Plan 08: Brand Icon and Final Sweep Summary

**Abstract geometric S brand icon, zero hardcoded colors confirmed via codebase sweep, visual verification approved**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min (including checkpoint wait)
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T14:42:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T14:56:56Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (1 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created abstract geometric "S" letterform brand icon as SVG favicon
- Confirmed zero hardcoded zinc-*, glass, or backdrop-blur references across entire src/ directory
- Updated layout.tsx metadata to reference new SVG favicon
- Human-verified both dark and light modes look professional and correct
- Phase 8.1 UI redesign is complete: all ~80+ component files migrated to semantic tokens

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create brand icon and sweep for remaining hardcoded colors** - `6f03b63` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Visual verification checkpoint** - human-verify approved (no commit)

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `sidekiq-webapp/public/favicon.svg` - Abstract geometric S brand icon, single-path SVG, blue accent color
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated metadata.icons to reference new SVG favicon

## Decisions Made

- Abstract "S" letterform chosen for brand icon -- geometric and modern, works at 16x16 favicon and inline sidebar mark
- Six intentional `text-white` instances retained in codebase -- these appear on colored backgrounds (e.g., avatars, primary buttons) where white text is semantically correct

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 8.1 (Rethink Branding & UI) is fully complete
- All components use semantic tokens exclusively
- Brand icon established as SVG favicon
- Ready for Phase 8.2 (Two-tier sidebar navigation architecture)
- No blockers or concerns

  - "Geist Mono as monospace font via --font-geist-mono CSS variable"
  - "Reduced border radius base (0.375rem / 6px)"
  - "--font-mono CSS variable in @theme block"

  - "Radius 0.375rem (6px) for sharp technical feel without zero-radius edges"
  - "Inter with display: swap for optimal font loading"
  - "Glassmorphism fully removed from CSS (component references remain for later plans)"
  - "Dark mode input border uses 12% white opacity (was 15%)"

patterns-established:
  - "Font loading: Inter + Geist_Mono via next/font/google with CSS variables"

# Phase 08.1 Plan 01: Design System Foundation Summary

**Blue-accent oklch color palette with Inter font, 6px base radius, and glassmorphism removal in globals.css + layout.tsx**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T14:08:58Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T14:12:02Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Complete blue-accent oklch color palette (hue 260) for both light and dark modes
- Inter loaded as primary sans-serif font replacing Geist, with Geist Mono for code
- Border radius reduced from 0.625rem to 0.375rem for sharp technical aesthetic
- Glassmorphism utility classes (.glass, .glass-subtle, .glass-input) removed from globals.css
- Scrollbar colors updated with slight blue tint for brand consistency

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Redefine CSS tokens and remove glassmorphism** - `92edf62` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Swap font from Geist to Inter + Geist Mono** - `e8aa1ca` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `sidekiq-webapp/src/styles/globals.css` - Complete color token system with blue accent oklch palette, updated radius, font references, glassmorphism removed, scrollbar colors updated
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/app/layout.tsx` - Inter + Geist_Mono font loading via next/font/google with CSS variables

## Decisions Made

- Used oklch hue 260 (blue-indigo) consistently across all non-neutral tokens for brand coherence
- Set --radius to 0.375rem (6px) which produces: sm=2px, md=4px, lg=6px, xl=10px - avoids zero-radius edges while maintaining sharp technical feel
- Dark mode primary slightly brighter (oklch 0.6 vs 0.55) for readability against dark backgrounds
- Dark mode input border uses 12% white opacity (reduced from previous 15%) per plan specification
- Chart tokens kept as-is (no design change needed for charts)
- Kept destructive color values unchanged (existing red oklch values)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All CSS tokens are the single source of truth for the visual redesign
- Components still reference removed glassmorphism classes (.glass, .glass-subtle, .glass-input in theme-toggle, chat-input, chat-interface, empty-state) - these will be updated in subsequent plans
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- Font variables are correctly wired: layout.tsx sets --font-inter and --font-geist-mono on html, globals.css @theme consumes them as --font-sans and --font-mono

# Phase 8.1 Plan 07: Team Component Semantic Tokens Summary

**All 12 team components migrated to semantic tokens -- role icons use text-primary/text-muted-foreground, status states use bg-muted/bg-destructive/10, zero hardcoded colors**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T14:30:54Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T14:33:40Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Replaced all hardcoded color references (amber, blue, green) with semantic tokens across team components
- Preserved team avatar rounded-lg shape distinct from user/sidekiq rounded-full
- Normalized icon sizing to `size-*` shorthand (was `h-* w-*`)
- Member rows now use hover:bg-accent/50 rounded-md for clean interaction states

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Restyle team display and management components** - `d20b7b8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Restyle team dialogs and forms** - `a500ad7` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/team/team-empty-state.tsx` - bg-primary/10 -> bg-muted, icon color to text-muted-foreground
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/team/team-member-row.tsx` - hover:bg-accent/50, role icons semantic, member name text-foreground
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/team/invite-member-dialog.tsx` - text-green -> text-primary, size-4 normalization
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/team/invite-accept-card.tsx` - All 5 states use semantic tokens for icons and containers
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/team/delete-team-dialog.tsx` - Warning text from amber to text-destructive

**Already clean (no changes needed):**
- team-avatar.tsx, team-settings-section.tsx, team-member-list.tsx, team-invites-list.tsx
- team-create-dialog.tsx, team-form.tsx, remove-member-dialog.tsx

## Decisions Made
- Owner Crown icon: text-primary (was text-amber-500) -- primary color represents the most important role
- Admin Shield icon: text-muted-foreground (was text-blue-500) -- secondary role uses muted color
- Expired invite: bg-muted (neutral) -- expired state is informational, not error
- Email mismatch: bg-destructive/10 (error) -- wrong email is an error condition requiring action
- Success state: text-primary (was text-green-600) -- primary color for positive confirmation
- Delete warning: text-destructive (was amber) -- destructive actions use destructive token

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written. 7 of 12 files were already clean from Phase 8 implementation.

## Issues Encountered
- Git pre-commit hook stash/unstash caused a HEAD reference conflict on first Task 2 commit attempt. Reset and re-staged to resolve.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All team components now use semantic tokens exclusively
- Ready for 08.1-08 (final verification and cleanup)
- Zero hardcoded colors confirmed via grep across entire team directory

## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Blue-accent color palette in dark mode
expected: Open the app in dark mode. The overall color scheme should have a blue-indigo accent throughout — primary buttons, links, and active states should show a consistent blue accent color instead of any previous green/purple/neutral tones.
result: pass

### 2. Blue-accent color palette in light mode
expected: Switch to light mode. Same blue-indigo accent should be visible on primary buttons, links, active states. The overall feel should be clean and professional with consistent blue accent.
result: pass

### 3. Inter font rendering
expected: Text throughout the app should render in Inter (sans-serif). Compare to the previous Geist font — Inter has slightly rounder letterforms. Code blocks should still use a monospace font (Geist Mono).
result: pass

### 4. Sharp border radius (6px base)
expected: Cards, buttons, inputs, and dialogs should have a sharper, more technical-looking border radius (6px / rounded-lg) instead of the previous rounder corners (rounded-xl). The feel should be crisp and precise.
result: pass

### 5. No glassmorphism effects
expected: No translucent/frosted-glass backgrounds or backdrop-blur effects should be visible anywhere in the UI. All surfaces should be solid colors (bg-card, bg-background, etc.).
result: pass

### 6. Dialogs styled as elevated cards
expected: Open any dialog (e.g., delete thread, rename, create Sidekiq template selection). The dialog should appear as a solid card with a subtle border and shadow — not a frosted glass overlay.
result: pass

### 7. Auth page branding and styling
expected: Visit the sign-in page. The brand name should display as lowercase "sidekiq". Form inputs should have subtle background differentiation (slightly muted). OAuth buttons should have clean outline styling. No hardcoded zinc/gray colors visible.
result: pass

### 8. Editor-like chat input
expected: In a chat thread, the chat input should look like a bordered card/editor container with a toolbar area at the top (showing model picker and/or Sidekiq badge) and the text area below. The textarea itself should be borderless inside the card.
result: pass

### 9. Chat header as defined bar
expected: The chat header should have a clear bottom border separating it from the chat content area. It should feel like a defined bar/section header, not floating.
result: pass

### 10. Sidebar with left accent bar active state
expected: In the sidebar, the currently active/selected thread should have a blue left accent bar (a vertical blue line on the left edge). This is the Linear-style active state indicator.
result: pass

### 11. Sidebar lowercase branding
expected: The sidebar header should show lowercase "sidekiq" as the brand name. When collapsed, it should show a lowercase "s" mark.
result: pass

### 12. New Chat button with blue accent
expected: The "New Chat" button in the sidebar should use the blue accent color (bg-sidebar-primary), making it stand out as the primary action.
result: pass

### 13. Sidekiq cards with clean styling
expected: Visit the Sidekiqs page. Each Sidekiq card should have a subtle border, card background, and light shadow (light mode only). Hovering should show a subtle blue border highlight (border-primary/30).
result: pass

### 14. Team role icons with semantic colors
expected: In team settings, the owner role icon (Crown) should use the primary blue color. Admin role icon (Shield) should use a muted/gray color. No amber, green, or hardcoded colors on role indicators.
result: pass

### 15. Brand icon favicon
expected: Check the browser tab — the favicon should show an abstract geometric "S" letterform in the blue accent color. It should be clean and readable at small sizes.
result: pass

### 16. Theme toggle consistency
expected: Toggle between dark and light modes. All surfaces, borders, text colors, and accents should transition cleanly. No elements should appear broken, missing styles, or still using old hardcoded colors in either mode.
result: pass

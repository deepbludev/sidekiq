# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 08.1-01
    provides: Design system foundation with semantic CSS tokens and oklch color system
  - phase: 08.1-02
    provides: UI primitive components updated with semantic tokens
provides:
  - All 20 Sidekiq and model picker components use semantic tokens exclusively
  - Sidekiq cards styled with border-border bg-card shadow-sm and hover:border-primary/30
  - Model picker trigger uses clean semantic border and background tokens
affects: [08.1-08, future-sidekiq-features]

# Phase 8.1 Plan 06: Sidekiq & Model Picker Semantic Token Migration Summary

**Sidekiq cards with border-border/shadow-sm, instructions editor with bg-card container, model-picker-trigger with clean semantic tokens**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T14:30:50Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T14:36:16Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 6

## Accomplishments
- Restyled Sidekiq card components (grid + list views) with border-border, bg-card, shadow-sm, and hover:border-primary/30
- Updated skeleton loading, instructions editor, conversation starters, and starter templates with consistent semantic tokens
- Cleaned model-picker-trigger by removing opacity-based border/background in favor of full semantic tokens
- Verified zero hardcoded zinc/glass/backdrop-blur colors across all 20 sidekiq and model-picker files

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Restyle Sidekiq components** - `15b74b7` (feat) - sidekiq-card, sidekiq-list, starter-templates, instructions-editor, conversation-starters
2. **Task 2: Restyle model picker components** - `596ee79` (feat) - model-picker-trigger

**Note:** Task 1 files were committed in `15b74b7` due to parallel agent commit race condition during lint-staged. All changes are present and verified.

## Files Created/Modified
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/sidekiq/sidekiq-card.tsx` - Grid: border-border bg-card shadow-sm rounded-lg hover:border-primary/30; List: same pattern; title: text-foreground font-medium
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/sidekiq/sidekiq-list.tsx` - Skeleton rounded-xl -> rounded-lg
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/sidekiq/starter-templates.tsx` - hover:border-primary/30, border-border for separator
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/sidekiq/instructions-editor.tsx` - Editor container: border-border bg-card rounded-lg
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/sidekiq/conversation-starters.tsx` - Starter items: border-border bg-card
- `sidekiq-webapp/src/components/model-picker/model-picker-trigger.tsx` - bg-background hover:bg-accent/50, border-border (removed opacity variants)

## Decisions Made
- Sidekiq cards use shadow-sm in light only (dark:shadow-none) for clean dark mode appearance
- hover:border-primary/30 chosen for consistent subtle interactive feedback across cards and templates
- Model picker trigger opacity-based border/bg removed in favor of full semantic tokens for consistency
- 14 of 15 sidekiq files and 4 of 5 model-picker files already used semantic tokens (no changes needed)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Most sidekiq and model-picker files were already using semantic tokens from prior phases. Changes focused on the specific improvements outlined in the plan.

## Issues Encountered
- Parallel agent commit race condition caused lint-staged ref lock errors on first Task 1 commit attempt. Task 1 files were ultimately committed in parallel agent's commit (15b74b7). Task 2 committed cleanly in 596ee79.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All Sidekiq and model picker components now use semantic tokens exclusively
- Ready for remaining Phase 8.1 plans (settings pages, final sweep)
- Avatar shape preserved: rounded-full for sidekiq avatars (via Avatar UI primitive)

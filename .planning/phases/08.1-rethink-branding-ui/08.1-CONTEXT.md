# Phase 8.1: Rethink Branding and UI to Match Linear Aesthetic - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Overhaul the design system and UI to shift from glassmorphism toward a Linear/Raycast-inspired minimalist, professional, polished aesthetic. This covers color palette, typography, component styling, and branding identity. All existing pages and components get restyled. No new features or capabilities are added.

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual Direction & Palette
- Inspired-by blend: take Linear's principles (clean, minimal, professional) but keep some Sidekiq personality — slightly more distinctive and playful than a strict Linear clone
- Blue accent color — the primary accent and brand color
- Near-black dark mode backgrounds (#0A0A0B range) — content stands out sharply against deep surfaces
- Equal treatment for both dark and light modes — both get full design attention
- Light mode uses true inversion (CSS variable swap) from dark mode palette
- Subtle 1px borders at ~10-15% opacity to define sections and panels
- Active/selected states use filled background + left accent bar for maximum clarity
- Subtle hover states (~5% opacity shift) — understated and professional
- Subtle gradient accents allowed on specific elements (header, accent buttons) but flat everywhere else
- Code blocks visually distinct: clearly different background, visible border, standing out from message text
- Toasts fully restyled to match new design language
- Dropdowns and popovers styled as Linear/Raycast-style crisp command menus — tight padding, subtle border, slight shadow lift
- Loading states (spinners, skeletons) fully restyled to match new design language
- Keyboard shortcut hints displayed as styled kbd elements with borders (Linear/Raycast-style)
- Reference apps: Linear + Raycast (clean + fun)

### Typography & Spacing
- Font: Inter — clean, neutral, excellent at small sizes
- Semibold (600) headings for strong but not heavy hierarchy
- Secondary text (timestamps, metadata): muted gray + 1-2px smaller than body
- Sidebar text slightly smaller than main content area — creates hierarchy between panels
- Chat input feels editor-like: slightly more structured with visible toolbar area and defined border
- Chat message line height: 1.5 (normal)
- Balanced density — medium padding and spacing (Linear's approach)

### Component Style Language
- Small/sharp border radius (4-6px) for a precise, technical feel
- Dialogs styled as elevated cards: visible border and slight shadow, dimmed backdrop
- Sidebar thread items include icons for context (sidekiq avatar, pin icon, etc.) alongside text
- Chat header is a defined bar with bottom border separating it from chat content
- Red accent for destructive actions (delete, remove) — clear, universally understood

### Branding Identity
- Brand personality: playful tech — fun, creative, developer-friendly (Raycast-inspired)
- App name styled as all lowercase 'sidekiq' — modern, casual, developer-friendly
- Brand treatment: icon + name — small icon/symbol next to the name
- Design a proper abstract geometric icon — works as favicon, app icon, and inline brand mark
- Blue is the brand color — accent = brand, one cohesive color identity
- Micro-copy tone: mix depending on context — direct for actions, friendly for empty states and onboarding

### Claude's Discretion
- Glassmorphism treatment: evaluate where glass adds value vs. where it clashes — remove or keep subtle hints per component
- Chat area vs sidebar background distinction: determine what creates the best reading experience
- Color token structure: pick the most maintainable approach for this codebase
- Monospace font for code blocks: pick what pairs best with Inter
- Base text size for chat messages: pick what works best for readability
- Section label treatment (uppercase/small-caps vs normal case): pick what fits the aesthetic
- Button styling approach: determine the right treatment for different contexts (ghost, bordered, filled)
- Form input styling: determine the right treatment for this design direction
- Avatar shapes: determine if current differentiation (round vs rounded-lg) should be kept or unified
- Badge/tag styling: pick the right approach for different contexts
- Card treatment (border, shadow, background shift): pick what works
- Focus ring styling: balance accessibility with aesthetics
- Scrollbar styling: pick what fits the overall aesthetic
- Empty state treatment: determine what fits the direction

## Specific Ideas

- "Linear + Raycast is the reference combo — clean + fun"
- Near-black surfaces like Linear, but with the playful personality of Raycast
- Active states should combine filled background AND left accent bar — "maximum clarity"
- Chat input should feel editor-like, not a simple text field
- Icon should be abstract geometric (like Linear's corner bracket or Vercel's triangle)
- Brand name always rendered as lowercase 'sidekiq'
- Kbd elements for keyboard shortcuts — styled bordered key badges
- Command menus should feel crisp and tight like Linear/Raycast

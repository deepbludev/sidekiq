Executing quick task 010: Update E2E tests for Phase 7 Sidekiq Chat Integration.

The planner completed and created 010-PLAN.md. The executor started and wrote the Phase 7 E2E tests to `sidekiq-webapp/tests/e2e/sidekiq.spec.ts`.

The tests have been written but NOT YET verified by running `pnpm test:e2e`.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan created: `.planning/quick/010-update-e2e-tests-for-phase-7/010-PLAN.md`
- E2E tests written to `sidekiq-webapp/tests/e2e/sidekiq.spec.ts`
  - Added "Sidekiq Chat Integration" test.describe block (lines 873-1267)
  - 7 tests covering Phase 7 features:
    1. should start chat with Sidekiq via URL
    2. should open Sidekiq picker with Cmd+Shift+S
    3. should select Sidekiq from picker and navigate
    4. should show Sidekiq indicator in chat header with popover
    5. should display conversation starters for Sidekiq
    6. should show Sidekiq in sidebar thread after sending message
    7. should preserve Sidekiq context when resuming thread
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Task 1 (in progress):
  - Run `pnpm test:e2e` from sidekiq-webapp directory to verify tests pass
  - Fix any failing tests
  - Create 010-SUMMARY.md
  - Update STATE.md with quick task completion
  - Commit changes
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Extended existing `sidekiq.spec.ts` rather than creating a new file
- Reused existing helpers (`createTestSidekiq`, `deleteSidekiqByName`)
- Added tests in serial mode to avoid rate limiting
- Used `[cmdk-item]` selector for Command palette items in picker test
- Used `force: true` for click operations to avoid dev overlay issues
</decisions_made>

<context>
Quick task 010 is adding Phase 7 Sidekiq Chat Integration E2E tests. The plan has one task that writes 7 new E2E tests covering the key Phase 7 features. The tests follow existing patterns in sidekiq.spec.ts and handle rate limiting gracefully.

The executor was interrupted mid-execution after writing the tests but before running verification.

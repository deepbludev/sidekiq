title: Extend available emoji options for Sidekiq avatar
area: ui
files:
  - src/components/sidekiq/avatar-picker.tsx
---

## Problem

The current AvatarPicker component for Sidekiq creation/editing has a limited set of emoji options for users to choose from. Users may want more variety when customizing their Sidekiq avatars to better represent the personality or purpose of their custom assistant.

## Solution

TBD - Expand the emoji palette in the AvatarPicker component. Consider:
- Adding more emoji categories (animals, objects, activities, etc.)
- Implementing emoji search/filtering
- Potentially using an emoji picker library for comprehensive options

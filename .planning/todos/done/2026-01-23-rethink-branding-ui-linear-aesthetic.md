title: Rethink branding and UI to match Linear aesthetic
area: ui

## Problem

Current UI/branding direction needs to be reconsidered. The goal is to achieve a look and feel similar to Linear.app — known for its minimalist, professional, and highly polished dark-mode-first interface with subtle animations, clean typography, and premium feel.

This would involve:
- Analyzing Linear's design system (colors, spacing, typography, motion)
- Evaluating current glassmorphism approach vs Linear's more solid/subtle style
- Considering component redesigns (sidebar, inputs, buttons, etc.)
- Branding elements (logo treatment, accent colors, iconography)

## Solution

TBD — Requires design exploration and potentially a design audit phase. May want to:
1. Document Linear's key design patterns
2. Create a style comparison with current Sidekiq UI
3. Propose specific changes or a phased redesign approach
